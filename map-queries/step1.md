This tutorial walks you through how to use SQL over maps with Hazelcast.

To get you started, we're installing Hazelcast and starting a Hazelcast member.

Before clicking **Continue**, wait until you see the following in the terminal, which means your cluster member is ready:

```bash
Members {size:1, ver:1} [
        Member [172.17.0.41]:5701 - 200fdc64-16a3-40b7-b55a-b22f51656730 this
]
```
